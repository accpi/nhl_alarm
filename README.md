Annoy your hockey friends by alerting them whenever they get scored on

The node utility scans for upcoming games for a team of your choice and will play a song of your choosing when they get scored on.
I recommend choosing Chelsea Dagger for a Vancouver Canucks fan, putting this on a Raspberry Pi and hiding in a present.


Pretty simple to set up and change, the Team ID in NHL API is for the team you choose, and you can replace sound.mp3 as you wish.
I used https://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayerwin/ to play sounds through MPlayer on Windows, you'll have to figure something depending on your system

Thanks to https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi for the API documentation
